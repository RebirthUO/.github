# Summary
Many Years ago RebirthUO were a freeshard runned by Tecmo, Ruaduck and Crome696. The shard closed around 2017 but the individuals are still more or less active within the ultima online emulation scene.

Since I (Crome696) were part of this community, IÂ´m taking over the name and will provide some useful content here and there.
